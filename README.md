# ABAP Dev Journal

Welcome! This repository is my personal space for documenting my journey learning ABAP and exploring application development on SAP BTP.

I started learning ABAP in May 2025 to deepen my understanding of application development and explore how modern enterprise apps are built using SAP technologies. This journal includes exercises, experiments, mini-projects, and notes on key topics like CDS views, RAP, unit testing, and more.
